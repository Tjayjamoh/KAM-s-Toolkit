                        3. You will also need to consider if your plan is realistic and achievable, and you will need to be able to back this up with research. It is essential to know your business, the market and your figures inside out

                      <p>•  Tax Pin and Tax compliance certificates From the <a href="http://www.kra.go.ke/">Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA)</a>  </p>
                      <p>•	A <strong>business plan</strong> with clear <a href="contact.html">financial projections</a>is usually a requirement depending on the level of funding. </p>
                      <p><strong>•	Statement of Purpose of Loan -</strong> banks usually approve of businesses using loans for the following reasons: - </p>
                               <p>*Improve Cash Flow </p>
                               <p>*Purchase Equipment </p>
                               <p>*Paying for Expansion Projects </p>    
                               <p>*Purchase Inventory </p>

                       <p><strong>•	Business Experience -</strong> based on the number of years in business and how the finances were managed, bankers will approve applications for loan if they are confident that the business will remain successful after receiving the loan.</p>
                       <p> <strong>•Personal Information Some financiers may require personal information including the following:</strong> - </p>
                       <p>*Addresses </p>
                       <p>*Criminal record if any</p>
                       <p>* Personal Loan/Debt Balances</p>
                       <p>*Information on your education </p>
                       <p>*Tax returns and compliance </p>
                       <p>*Financial statements </p>
                       <p>*Assets owned</p>
                      <p><strong>•Financial Statements -</strong> banks will mostly require a balance sheet, income statements, profit and loss statement, cash flow statement, other financial projections and your business's bank account statement </p>
                     <p>
                        <strong>•Loan/Credit Guarantee –</strong> some cases, the business owner is required to sign a written promise to repay the business loan/debt using personal assets in the event that the business cannot pay the loan/debt balance. This is a personal Guarantee. However, institutional guarantees where provided subject to terms and conditions of the facility may be sufficient cover for the credit/loan. Individual guarantors can guarantee relatively small loans, as it happens in SACCOs and various micro-finance institutions.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                      <p><i><strong>Additionally, financiers will require the following depending on the type and level of funding</strong></i></p>
                      <p><i><strong>Demonstration of consistent cash flow;</strong></i>financial institutions tend to favor MSMEs that have a steady revenue stream and consistent cash flow every month. This can be demonstrated through past financial records. Sometimes Lenders and investors will require bank statements or Audited Accounts for a period of 1-5 years.</p> 
                      <br>
                      <p><i><strong>Collateral;</strong></i>Financiers will require sufficient collateral for<i><strong>secured loans.</strong></i>This however depends on the specific institutions terms for the loan required. Acceptable collateral includes such items as title deeds, Logbook, listed Stocks at NSE, Life insurance policies and cash in a bank or at hand.</p>
                      <p>This may not apply for <i><strong>unsecured loans.</strong></i></p>
                      <br>
                      <p><i><strong>Debt-to-income ratio; </strong></i>Some MSME owners seek credit from multiple lenders, especially during the start-up phase. Fanciers will want to check the debt levels against the businesses income.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p><i><strong>Customer concentrations;</strong></i>Financiers generally like dealing with businesses that demonstrate diversity in their clientele as opposed to dealing with the same customers year in year out. They are skeptical of businesses that report a significant bulk of their sales from only a select few customers as this may indicate risk should these customers stop doing business with you.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p><i><strong>Operating history;</strong></i>Lenders give preferential treatment to businesses with lengthy and significant records of accomplishment and with sustained amount of success and credibility.</p>
                       <br>
                       <p><i><strong>Management team;</strong></i>Lenders, investors and grant providers will prefer businesses that have strong top-level leadership with a noticeable chain of command because they are concerned about the organizational integrity and long-term success of the business.</p>
                       <br>
                       <p><i><strong>Credit rating;</strong></i>Good rating by Credit Reference Bureaus (CRBs) qualifies one for debt financing as well as attracting investors.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
