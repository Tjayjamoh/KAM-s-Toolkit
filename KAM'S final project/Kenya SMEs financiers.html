The following are various financial institutions; each distinctly offering value add to MSMEs in Kenya.

                     <p>The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) is the primary regulator of the banking industry. The primary classification of banks in Kenya is by ownership. Some banks belong to local individuals/companies while others belong to foreign individuals or organizations. Another general classification of banks is by nature, that is, microfinance banks and commercial banks. The CBK, which governs banks further, classifies commercial banks based on their assets. Tier 1 banks are large banks that have hundreds of billions in assets and are not likely to collapse financially. They are the top banks in Kenya. Tier 2 banks are medium-sized banks while tier 3 consists of small banks.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>As at December 31, 2021, the Kenyan banking sector comprised of the following (CBK Annual report 2021)</p>

                      One of the ways of raising capital for MSMEs is listing or investing in stocks at the <a href="https://www.nse.co.ke/dataservices/">Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)</a>  for returns that can be later used to finance business operations and growth. For a company to get its securities listed on a stock exchange they must make an application and issue a prospectus. The stock exchange will review the prospectus and decide whether it meets their eligibility requirements for listing for public offering (IPO).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      A company can also raise equity financing through private placement. In a private placement, a prospectus or memorandum would be given to an investor, which will outline the company’s plans and what an investor is offered for their capital. <a href="https://www.cma.or.ke/information_toolkit/">See the Capital Markets Information Toolkit for more information</a> on raising funds from the stock exchange.

                        <h3 class="jumbotron text-center h3" id="Debt">Government funds.</h3>
                       <p>
                        The Kenya Government established Youth Enterprise Development Fund (2006), Women Enterprise Fund (2007) and UWEZO Fund (2013) as vehicles for <strong>special groups</strong> (Youth, women, disabled persons and small enterprises) to access cheap business loans from the Government. These funds are being re-organized into a <strong>Biashara Kenya Fund</strong>  that will give loans directly to the special groups for as low as 6% interest. This is way below the commercial banks’ lending at a Weighted Rate of 12.15% (CBK, March 2022) and is desirable for MSMEs growth. Youth and Women owned enterprises are allocated 35% each while 17% is allocated to other MSMEs, leaving 10% for people with disabilities and 3% as an administration cost.

                       <h3 class="jumbotron text-center h3" id="Debt">Credit Guarantee Schemes (CGSs).</h3>
                       <p>
                        Credit Guarantee Schemes (CGSs) are specialized institutions or programs set up by the government and development partners, which pledge to repay some, or the entire loan amount to the lender in case of default of the SME borrower. This reduces the lender’s expected credit losses, acting as a form of insurance against default (WB 2022). A CGS can lower the amount of collateral that the SME needs to pledge to receive a loan, because it effectively provides a substitute for collateral.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In addition to improving access to finance for SMEs, CGSs can potentially play a more important role, especially in countries with weak institutional environments, by improving the information available on SME borrowers in coordination with credit registries and bureaus, and by building the credit origination and risk management capacity of participating lenders, for example through technical assistance for the setup of SME units. Moreover, CGSs can also play an important countercyclical role, providing support to small businesses during a downward economic cycle.
                       </p>
                       <br>

                        In the 2020/21 financial year, the state set aside Ksh 3.0 billion to the scheme, allowing lenders to disburse at least KSh 12 billion to business entities that meet the set requirements. The Kenyan government through amendment of the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act 2012 provided for the establishment of a MSMEs Credit Guarantee scheme and development of Public Finance Management (Credit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 2020.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The National Treasury signed an agreement with seven (7) commercial banks <a href="https://www.co-opbank.co.ke/">(ABSA, Cooperative Bank, Credit Bank, Diamond Trust Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank, NCBA</a>  and <a href="https://www.stanbicbank.co.ke/">Stanbic bank)</a> who act as financial intermediaries in provision of credit to MSMEs. The banks are expected to lend out their money and follow the normal bank procedures for lending to minimize default risk. The funds in the scheme will be used as compensation to banks in the event of default.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In 2021, Credit Guarantee Scheme facilities totaling around Ksh 2.1bn were issued to around 1,291 MSMEs. Beneficiary MSMEs were distributed across 45 counties, 11 different economic sectors and employing 8, 975 Kenyans

                        <strong>What is a Credit Guarantee Scheme?</strong>
                        <p>A Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) is an arrangement designed to reduce risk associated with lending to MSMEs. It is like an insurance policy that gives lenders confidence to extend credit to potentially high-risk borrowers.</p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>How is this program helping SMEs?</strong>
                          Through the credit Guarantee Scheme, appointed banks are now able to disburse affordable loans faster, lend more and take on more risky SME borrowers. Benefits of the CGS to the borrower include:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          1) Attractive repayment periods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         2) Lower loan security requirements i.e., easier collateral requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         3) Ability to lend to more MSMEs, who were
                        </p>
                        <strong>Is this SME Guarantee like a grant?</strong>
                        <p>
                          The funds disbursed under this Programme are not grants. These are loans, which result into a contractual debt obligation. The capital (money) that MSMEs will access through the banks will need to be repaid according to the agreed terms and conditions and in line with the gazetted CGS regulations. As such, there are penalties for loan default under this program.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Where can borrowers access loans under the CGS?</strong>
                        <p>
                          Loans under the Government Guarantee program are available at <a href="https://www.absabank.co.ke/business/">ABSA Bank, </a><a href="https://www.co-opbank.co.ke/">Cooperative Bank,</a> <a href="https://creditbank.co.ke/">Credit Bank,</a> <a href="https://dtbk.dtbafrica.com/loans/The-Credit-Guarantee-Scheme">Diamond Trust Bank,</a> <a href="https://ke.kcbgroup.com/"> Kenya Commercial Bank,</a><a href="https://ke.ncbagroup.com/">NCBA</a>  and <a href="https://www.stanbicbank.co.ke/">Stanbic bank)</a> .

                        <strong>How will the Government ensure the banks do not take advantage and over-charge the MSMEs or become unfair in any other way?</strong>
                        <p>
                          Every participating bank will provide performance reports to the Administrator at National Treasury, as per the Public Finance Management (Credit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations, 2020. This reporting mechanism is designed to enable accountability and full transparency.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Are there any consequences for an MSME that borrows and fails to pay back or uses the money for expenses other than what the loan was approved for?</strong>
                        <p>
                          Yes, there are consequences for failure to repay the loan and for loan fraud. As stipulated in the Public Finance Management (Credit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 2020, borrowers face prosecution of up to two years should they fail to do the following:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          * Willfully apply the funds borrowed under the guaranteed credit facility to any purpose other than the purpose for which the credit was approved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          * After securing the loan under the guaranteed credit facility, knowingly destroy or misappropriate any security given.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          * Knowingly give false information; or

                        <p>
                          * Willfully destroy any assets used as collateral by a participating financial intermediary.
                         
                      </p>
