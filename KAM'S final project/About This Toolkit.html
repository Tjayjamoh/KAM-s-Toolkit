       <P>Kenyan Manufacturing SMEs are at a higher risk of buckling under the pressures of low demand, decreased turnover, and rising costs. Considering the contribution of Manufacturing SMEs to the socio- economic development, employment, and livelihoods, it is imperative that cushioning them from the negative effects of Covid-19 pandemic is the most rational action. While the government has instituted many measures towards this objective, the private sector and development partners are equally called to supplement the public sector initiatives to secure the SMEs, incomes, jobs, and employment hence livelihoods.</P>
        <br>
        <p>KAM has therefore sought to ensure survival of manufacturing SMEs and create preconditions for a robust recovery in business, incomes, jobs and employment. KAM in pursuit of promoting Manufacturing SMEs has collaborated with development partners among them the GIZ to come-up with a tailor made SMEs development programme including development of online digital toolkits for effective delivery of its services.</p>
       <p class="p">This toolkit aims at facilitating interactions and information sharing between Demand side (The SMEs) and the Supply side (Debt, Equity and Grant providers) for mutual benefits. It is a partnership initiative of KAM and the GIZ.
        </p>
       <p>After this brief introduction, the toolkit looks into <a href="SMEs Financing Landscape in Kenya.html">SMEs financing Landscape</a> which is informed by various reports and surveys done on the subject prior to, during and post Covid-19 period. The toolkit has a section for information about the different  <a href="Debt, Equity and Grants.html"> types of funding for SMEs</a> covering Debt, Equity and Grants including guidelines for choosing one over others. It also includes a section profiling  <a href=""> KAM Manufacturing SMEs</a> by sector and membership, Information on <a href="KAMs SME Development.html"> KAM SME development</a> and listed possible <a href="a - Copy (3).html"> Debt, Equity and Grant funding institutions </a> accessible to Kenyan SMEs like Commercial Banks, Microfinance Banks, SACCOS, Stock Markets, Guarantee Funds and Venture Capital firms. The toolkit provides <a href="contact.html"> Useful Links and resources </a> for Business registration, taxation, regulatory and government ministries and SAGAs that support enterprises in the country.</p>
        <p>Tools and guidlines for<span style="color: rgb(52, 52, 163);">Business Planning</span> and <a href="Planning to Raise Finance.html"><span style="color: blue;">financial planning</span></a> as requisites for fund raising are also provided.
