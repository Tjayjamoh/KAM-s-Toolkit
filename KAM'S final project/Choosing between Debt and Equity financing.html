                <h3 id="h5" class="jumbotron text-center h3">Choosing between Debt and Equity financing </h3>
                <p>
                    Choosing which one works for you between Debt and Equity is dependent on several factors such as your current profitability, future profitability, reliance on ownership and control, and whether you can qualify for one or the other. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When deciding whether to seek debt or equity financing, businesses usually consider these three factors:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What source of funding is most easily accessible for the Enterprise?</li>
                    <li>What is the Enterprises cash flow?</li>
                    <li>How important is it for principal owners to maintain complete control of the Enterprise?</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Securing equity financing can be a simpler process than debt financing, but you need to have an extremely attractive product or financial projections, as well as being able to surrender a portion of your Business and oftentimes a good amount of control.

                <p>
                    While perhaps the best for start-ups and social impact projects, Grant funding has its pros and cons
                </p>
                <h6 id="h6" class="container-fluid"><br>Pros of Business Grants</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>Free Money;</strong> Grants do not need to be repaid, which is what makes them so appealing for business endeavors. </li>
                    <br> <li>
                      <strong> Accessible Info;</strong> is a lot of information about where, how, when, and who to get grants from. When you know what industry you are getting into, there is tons of information and resources at your fingertips.
                    </li>
                    <br> <li>
                       <strong>Ripple Effect;</strong> once you have been awarded one grant, you are more likely to receive others. Since someone has already given you this free money, other organizations will see you as a reliable candidate.
                    </li>
                   <br> <li>
                       <strong>Gain Credibility and publicity; </strong> some of the most coveted grants can provide benefits that outweigh the simple free money advantage. Grants can also promote your business and idea, showing that your work is of notice.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="jumbotron h3" id="About">Cons of Business Grants</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Time-Consuming; you will have to do a lot of research and fill out a lot of paperwork if you want to apply for a grant. Once you find a grant, the proposal is the most important thing. If your idea or venture is creative, it will not get you that grant without a convincing proposal.
                    </li>
                   <br> <li>
                        Difficult to Receive; There are many people who want the free money that grants provide. With thousands of small and online businesses out there, many of them are working to receive free money as well. Be prepared for tough competition, but do not let that inhibit you.
                    </li>
                    <br> <li>
                        Uncertain Renewal; Business grants are not always renewed. Suddenly, you may no longer receive funding. You may have to reapply for grants year after year and make sure that your business will stay steady if your grant is not renewable.
                    </li>
                    <br> <li>
                        Strings Attached; although grants are free money, they still come with plenty of restrictions and conditions. You must be very specific about how you will be using the money when you apply for a grantâ€”once you get the money, you have to stick to that plan. 
                    </li>
