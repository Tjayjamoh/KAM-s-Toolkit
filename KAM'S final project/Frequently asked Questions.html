                <p><i><strong> Why should an enterprise go for Grant Funding?</strong></i></p>
                <p>The advantages and disadvantages of business grants point to the idea of free money for your business. If you are willing to invest time in your idea, go for it. The pros and cons of grants for business mean nothing if the belief in your idea is not solid.</p>

                <p><i><strong>Why Would an Enterprise Choose Debt Over Equity Financing?</strong></i></p>
               <p>
                A company would choose debt financing over equity financing if it does not want to surrender any part of its company. A company that believes in its financials would not want to miss on the profits they would have to pass to shareholders if they assigned someone else equity.
               </p>

                <p><i><strong>Is Debt Cheaper Than Equity?</strong></i></p>
               <p>
                This will depend on how well the business performs, debt can be cheaper than equity, but the opposite is also true. If your business is making no profit and is almost closing, then in essence your equity financing costs you nothing. If you take out a business loan via debt financing and you turn no profit, you still need to pay back the loan plus interest. In this scenario, debt financing costs more. However, if your company is selling well and making profits, the amount you pay shareholders could be much more than if you had kept that ownership and simply paid a loan. Each circumstance is different.
               </p>
                <p><i><strong>Is Debt Financing or Equity Financing Riskier?</strong></i></p>
               <p>
                Debt financing can be riskier if you are not profitable as there will be loan pressure from your lenders. However, equity financing can be risky if your investors expect you to turn a healthy profit, which they often do. If they are unhappy, they could try to negotiate for cheaper equity or divest altogether.

               <p><i><strong>What is Venture Capital and how is it acquired?</strong></i></p>
               <p>
                Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity and a type of financing that, investors usually provide to startup companies and existing small enterprises that are believed to have long-term growth potential. Venture capital generally comes from well-off investors, investment banks, and any other financial institutions. However, it does not always take a monetary form; it can also be provided in the form of technical or managerial expertise. Venture capital is typically allocated to small companies with exceptional growth potential, or to companies that have grown quickly and appear poised to continue to expand.
               </p>
               <p>
                The first step for any business looking for venture capital is to submit a proposal with business plan, either to a venture capital/Private equity firm or to an angel investor. If interested in the proposal, the firm or the investor must then perform due diligence, which includes a thorough investigation of the company's business model, products, management, and operating history, among other things. VCs also look for opportunities in industries that they are familiar with, and the chance to own a large percentage of the company so that they can influence its direction.

               <p><strong>Who is an angel investor?</strong></p>
               <p>
                An angel investor is usually a <strong>high-net-worth individual</strong> who funds startups at the early stages, often with their own money. Angel investors are also called informal investors, angel funders, private investors, seed investors or business angels. Angel investors are focused on helping startups take their first steps, rather than the possible profit they may get from the business
