                    Debt financing is any type of loan that an enterprise uses to fund its business as part of the capital raising process. Essentially, when a business chooses to fund their working capital with a loan, it means they get their money from an outside source. This incurs a debt to the lender of those funds.

                <p><br>The ability to secure debt financing is largely based on your existing financials and creditworthiness.Loans can be either long or short term, based on the needs of your business.</p>

                <p> <strong>Short-term debt financing </strong> applies to day-to-day operations - such as supplies, inventory management, and wages and are generally repaid in less than a year. The reason for choosing short-term debt finance varies from business to business, but it generally helps with temporary cash flow issues, which are common for startups.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Long term debt financing</strong> on the other hand, often applies to business assets such as land, equipment or buildings. Repayment of a long-term debt finance can be up to 10 years or more.
